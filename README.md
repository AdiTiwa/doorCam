# AutoCam README

DoorCam is an open source camera software for detecting and logging faces at your door. 


![Face Detection Image](https://i.ibb.co/VNsLC7r/1-PDA9z-ADq-D9qq-Cu-Cm-J9-Ddw.gif)

It’s built on the face recognition library, which allows the model to detect AND remember faces that show up at your front door.

The software keeps a log of who’s already been seen by the camera and compares the detected face to the logs to let some people in, and keep some people out.

The software works with the DoorCam lock, which sends the recognized faced through the system and unlocks the door!

This can work with any camera, but most cameras don’t have locks built in, so all you’d be doing is logging faces. 

The code in the repo is commented. Have fun!
